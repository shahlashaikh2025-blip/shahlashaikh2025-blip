 🚀 Junior Data Analyst | Power BI Developer | Software Engineer
    


I have completed my BCIT from Sindh University, which provided me with a strong academic foundation in information technology and computing concepts.

I have recently learned Python, NumPy, and Pandas, and I am capable of performing data analysis using these tools. I have successfully completed my Data Analyst training, where I worked on data cleaning, visualization, and extracting meaningful insights from datasets.

Currently, I am studying Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at Saylani, where I am further enhancing my analytical and technical skills to work with real-world data and AI-driven solutions.

In addition, I have knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I can create responsive web pages, allowing me to work across both data analysis and web development.

I am highly passionate about programming and continuously strive to improve my skills. My long-term goal is to become a skilled IT programmer and data professional, and to build a successful career in the technology field.
